# pipeline-library
a shared library between example pipelines

## Setup
This is a pipeline library to be used with Jenkins pipelines. It can be setup multiple ways, but the simplest way is to implicitly load the lbrary at the 
global or folder level, and reference it at the top of each Jenkinsfile.
